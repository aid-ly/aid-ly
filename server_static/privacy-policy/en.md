Aid-ly.org is a non-profit, open source website designed to connect communities with organizations.
Our platform enables non-profit organizations to post their locations on an interactive map, allowing users to discover nearby opportunities where they can contribute their time and skills to meaningful causes—supporting local communities, environmental projects, and international initiatives.
We are committed to protecting your privacy and handling your data responsibly in compliance with the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and the Garante per la Protezione dei Dati Personali (GPDP).

Any third-party services used (e.g., Simple Analytics) are selected for their commitment to user privacy.

## Geolocation Access and Mapping Services

- **Geolocation Access**: Our website may request access to your device’s location to enhance your experience by showing nearby posts on our interactive map. This geolocation data is processed locally on your device and is not stored on our servers. If you decline to share your location, you can still manually browse the map.
- **Mapping Services**: We use Mapbox GL to render the interactive map that displays posts and organizational locations. Mapbox GL may collect usage data in accordance with its own privacy policy. We encourage you to review Mapbox’s privacy practices for more details.
